**Lisbeth.Workshop** is a collection of Lisbeth order exports for Airship and Submersible parts.  Since they can't be requested directly in Lisbeth, importing these orders saves a lot of time setting up the sub-orders yourself.

Folders are organized by vessel class, with separate JSON files per vessel part.  This lets you mix and match parts by importing each one individually.

Use [LlamaLibrary's][3] `FCWorkshopBase` BotBase to quickly submit the materials crafted by these orders.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

 * [RebornBuddy][4] with active license (paid)
 * [Lisbeth][5] with active license (paid)
 * (Optional) [LlamaLibrary][3] for `FCWorkshopBase` (free)

### Setup

 1. Download the [latest version][2].
 2. Unzip to any folder of your choice.

## Usage

 1. In RebornBuddy, set BotBase to `Lisbeth`.
 2. Open `BotBase Settings` to open Lisbeth's window.
 3. In Lisbeth on the `Orders` tab, click `Import` and select the JSON files for the vessel parts you want.  Multiple imports are additive, so you can add everything at once.
 4. Click `Expansion` and double check nothing special is missing (look for `(!)` items at the top).
 5. Back in RebornBuddy, click `Start`.
 6. (Optional; requires LlamaLibrary) After crafting finishes, set BotBase to `FCWorkshopBase` to automatically submit the materials.
